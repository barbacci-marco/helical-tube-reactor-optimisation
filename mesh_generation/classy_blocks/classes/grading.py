# In theory, combination of three of these 6 values can be specified:
#  - Total length
#  - Number of cells
#  - Total expansion ratio
#  - Cell-to-cell expansion ratio
#  - Width of start cell
#  - Width of end cell

# In reality, some of them are useless:
#  - Total length: determined by geometry
#  - Total expansion ratio: no physical meaning/usefulness

# Also in reality, some are very important:
#  - Width of start cell: required to keep y+ <= 1
#  - Cell-to-cell expansion ratio: 1 < recommended <= 1.2
#  - Number of cells: the obvious meshing parameter
#  - Width of end cell: matching with cell sizes of the next block

# Possible Combinations to consider are:
#  - start_size & c2c_expansion
#  - start_size & count
#  - start_size & end_size
#  - end_size & c2c_expansion
#  - end_size & count
#  - count & c2c_expansion

# Some nomenclature to avoid confusion
# Grading: the whole grading specification (length, count, expansion ratio)
# length: length of an edge we're dealing with
# count: number of cells in a block for a given direction
# total_expansion: ratio between last/first cell size
# c2c_expansion: ratio between sizes of two neighbouring cells
# start_size: size of the first cell in a block
# end_size: size of the last cell in a block
# division: an entry in simpleGrading specification in blockMeshDict

# calculations meticulously transcribed from the blockmesh grading calculator:
# https://gitlab.com/herpes-free-engineer-hpe/blockmeshgradingweb/-/blob/master/calcBlockMeshGrading.coffee
